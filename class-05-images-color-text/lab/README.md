# Week 1 Project: About Me
# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 5

There are two parts to today's lab assignment. Each is in a different assignment in Canvas.

## First Part: Over the weekend

Put finishing touches on your About Me project and get it deployed to a GitHub page. This will be due at 11:59pm on Sunday evening. The more time you spend with this, the better you'll get at CSS, but keep in mind that you also have readings to do and need to get some rest and relaxation in as well! We have a HUGE week next week, so be sure to come into it refreshed and ready.

### Submitting Your Assignment

- Submit the link to your GitHub repo for this project **AND** the link to your deployed GitHub page.

> Assignments that do not meet the required professional standards will not be graded. Weâ€™ll ask you to update your work to meet the requirements and resubmit. Required professional standards include:
a clear commit history with commit messages that describe why the changes were made; your code passes an eslint test.
