#### Git

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

##### Git command basics:

- `git status`              Provides a detailed description of current state in working directory

- `git add <file/s>`          Include file/s in staged/tracked status of working directory; you can use `.` as a wildcard to capture all files

- `git commit -m "Your commit message"`        Snapshot the tracked changes in current working directory, with a brief message describing the changes

- `git push <destination> <branch>`                Push local commits to GitHub

### Add, Commit, Push (ACP): Learn it. Know it. Live it.
