            * `debugger;`

    * Your brain
        * WHAT info is wrong? WHERE and WHEN in my code do I use that info?
        * Scientific method:
            * Observe what's happening, identify what's incorrect
            * Research related code and hypothesize what it might be
            * Test solutions by changing code and verifying its effect
            * Repeat until solution is found
