# Learning Journal

## Today I Learned...

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. Dedicating a few moments to revisit what you've learned helps deepen your new found understanding as well as helps you formulate questions around things you don't yet understand. This learning journal is a space for you to express whatever is on your mind around learning to code. It is for your own reflection more than it is another thing for us to assess you on.

## Tasks

- Create a gist on gist.github.com with the file name `daily-learning-journal.md`. You can make it a public or private gist.

- For each day of class, add a header using markdown syntax: `# Class 1`. Write your entry underneath this header.

    - Write about what you learned, what may or may not have happened in group work, what you're hoping for, etc. Your entry may contain code samples, links to additional resources you found, or anything else you feel is relevant. 

## Example

See the following link for an example of how your learning journal should look. (Click the `Raw` button in the top right corner to see what it looks like in Markdown.)
