# Week 1 Project: About Me
## Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 1

- Write a program that accepts user input and displays messages back to the user based on that input.
- [Install Node and Eslint](install-node.md).
    - If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away.
- Start your [learning journal](LEARNING_JOURNAL.md)!

## Technical Requirements

- Create an HTML file with four questions in a series of `<p>` tags.
- Use JavaScript's 'prompt' function to ask a user those same four questions.
- After each question, use the 'alert' function to provide a response using their answer in the text:
    - Store the user's response to each question in its own variable. Name your variables carefully.
    - Concatenate their response into some kind of reply. Pass this into an 'alert' function.
    - Strive to have your alert for each question use the responses to all of the prior questions so that by the fourth question, your response would look something like, "Greetings, *Iggy* from *Ipanema*, I also like to eat *bananas* while on vacation in *Paris*."
- In addition, for each response, log a message to the console using `console.log()`. The message should include the nature of the question and the user's response.
- Be creative and have fun with your questions and responses! They can be whatever you want so long as the input/output requirements are met.

## Submitting Your Assignment
