# Week 2 Project: Salmon Cookies

In class, we learned how to model an entity in JavaScript using objects. Now, it's your turn to build an application that models the problem domain in the support doc linked in the `assets/` directory.

You will also be working with more specific style and design concepts throughout this week's project.

Before writing a single line of code, create a new repository called `cookie-stand`, and do your work in that directory. Each day you'll be working in a new branch. Once the repo is initialized and set up today, switch to a new branch for your work. Branch names can be whatever you want; we suggest naming them after the main feature you'll be building that day, such as `hourly-calculations` for today and `table-view` tomorrow.

### User Stories (MVP)
 - As the owner of the cookie business, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about my shops' inventory needs.
 - As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information.
 - As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand.

### User Stories (Stretch... only after completing everything above)
 - As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business

### Technical Requirements
 - New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine
 - Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history
 - Good use of object literals **(no constructors allowed today)**; one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names
 - Sales page meets requirements of the problem domain
 - Stores are correctly rendering as lists to the sales page
